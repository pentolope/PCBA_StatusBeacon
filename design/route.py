"""Regenerate the placed board, then hand routing to the toolkit.

The candidate search this file used to run privately - attempt loop,
tidy passes, acceptance gating, provenance record - is owned by the
toolkit's `run.py route`, driven by the routing.search and
routing.transforms declarations in board/manifest.json. `--adopt` is
the toolkit's one sanctioned promotion of an accepted candidate into
the tree, digest-verified against its record.
